This is a test for the keyboard. After initializing the interrupt
system, the program waits for keyboard interrupts. As soon as a byte
is sent by the keyboard, its hex representation is output on serial
line 0 (as are the initialization messages). If you run this test on
the simulator, be sure to give the input focus to the console screen.
