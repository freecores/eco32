This is a test for the interrupt system. Every second the timer interrupts
and the next lower-case character of the character set is sent to serial
line 0 , starting 10 characters below 'a' and repeating from 'a' as soon
as 'z' is reached. The PSW ('S') and the interrupt return address ('R')
are output along with the character.
