There are four different ways to run a standalone program.

1. Simulator: Load the program with the '-l' command-line option
   into the simulated memory; use '-a 0x10000' to set the load
   address. Each Makefile has a target 'run' to automate this.

2. Simulator: Pack the program onto a simulated disk (this will
   happen automatically if you use the Makefile target 'run-sim'
   in the subdirectory build/run). Boot this disk. Choose the
   partition with the bootable EOS32 file system, and enter
   '/boot/<progname.bin>' as the 'path to kernel'.

3. FPGA: Load the program with the help of the load server. Type
   'loadserv <serial_device> <progname.exo>' on the PC side, and
   'load 1' on the FPGA side (which runs the machine monitor).

4. FPGA: Pack the program onto a simulated disk and make the disk
   available for use with the help of the disk server (this will
   happen automatically if you use the Makefile target 'run-server'
   in the subdirectory build/run). Type 'boot 1' on the FPGA side
   (which runs the machine monitor), and proceed as in 2.
