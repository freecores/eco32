Basic Tasks For The System Loader
---------------------------------

1) Interactively accept a path to an operating system kernel executable.
2) Traverse the file system from root to the kernel executable.
3) Read the kernel executable (possibly with indirect blocks).
4) Interpret the file format (ELF) while reading the kernel.
5) Start the loaded kernel (possibly with arguments).
