\chapter{Introduction}
The ECO32 is a general-purpose 32-bit RISC soft-core microprocessor, to be
implemented on an FPGA. It was originally designed to understand the RISC
architecture as described by Hennessy and Patterson in their books. The
current version is a simple, albeit slow implementation of the instruction
set architecture described in this manual. Future versions will include
various optimizations to make the ECO32 feasible for real-world projects.

\section{Features}
The \eco supports the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Soft-core processor to be implemented on an FPGA
\item 32 general-purpose registers, each 32 bits wide
\item 32-bit ALU, shifter, multiplication and division units
\item load/store architecture
\item 32-bit unified instruction and data address space
\item 16 external interrupt lines
\item two privilege modes to execute both trusted and untrusted code
\item paged virtual memory with a page size of 4K
\item assembler, instruction-set simulator, and C compiler support
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}
So far, the \eco has only been implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA. Implementing it on other FPGAs may cause problems if the \eco uses device primitives that are not supported on the target platform.
